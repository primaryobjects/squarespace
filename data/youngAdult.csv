Middle Grades,dbeck.jacobson@outlook.com,Darlene Beck-Jacobson,"Eleven year old Jack misses his Dad who is MIA in Vietnam. It's been months since he and his family had word of his whereabouts. The last thing Jack wants to do is spend summer with his grandparents. Mom believes it will be good for them all -- Jack, his sister Katy, Mom, Gran and Pops -- to be together while they wait for word about Dad. Keeping busy will keep them out of trouble and help them think of other things.

Jack expects the worst summer of his life. The first summer without. Without Dad, without friends, without his room and all the things that remind him of Dad. When Jack meets a girl named Jill -- a girl with a brother who makes trouble for both of them -- things they believe are turned upside down. Welcome to a summer of fishing, camping, bullies, and a fish who grants wishes. A fish that could be the answer to Jack's problem. But when Jill makes wishes of her own, things don't turn out the way they expected. Every wish has a consequence.

Will the fish grant Jack's biggest wish?  Will Jack be brave enough to ask?","Darlene Beck Jacobson is a former teacher and speech therapist who has loved writing since she was a girl. She is also a lover of history and can often be found mining dusty closets and drawers in search of skeletons from her past. She enjoys adding these bits of her ancestry to stories such as the middle grade historical novel WHEELS OF CHANGE (Creston 2014) which is a 2015 Notable Social-Studies Trade Book from the Children‚Äôs Book Council (CBC), A 2015 Mighty Girl Pick, and The Grateful American Book Prize Honorable mention for 2015. Her middle grade novel-in-verse WISHES, DARES, AND HOW TO STAND UP TO A BULLY (Creston 2020) is a Notable Verse Novel for 2021 from the CBC.

Darlene lives and writes her stories in New Jersey with her family and a house full of dust bunnies. She's caught many fish, but never asked one to grant her a wish. She's a firm believer in wishes coming true, so she tries to be careful what she wishes for.

Her blog features recipes, activities, crafts, articles on nature, book reviews, and interviews with children's book authors and illustrators.","WISHES, DARES, AND HOW TO STAND UP TO A BULLY (Creston 2020)  ISBN: 978-1-939547-62-0",http://www.darlenebeckjacobson.com,,,https://twitter.com/dbjacobson,,,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/ad458d96-15eb-43de-ae1a-64802d962dda/Beck-Jacobson_Headshot.jpg,Being able to talk face to face with readers about their favorite books and authors and feel the excitement as they share their enthusiasm.,,"Being outside at my favorite venue is always something to look forward to.

Middle Grades,charlotteebennardo@gmail.com,Charlotte Bennardo,"The Evolution Revolution Trilogy (Simple Machines, Simple Plans, Simple Lessons) follows the adventure of a gray squirrel named Jack, who makes friends with Collin, a young boy. Jack becomes distressed when construction machines show up, planning to cut down his woods and tree. When Collin shows Jack how to use simple machines like the wheel, Jack begins a plan to use what Collin teaches him and gather all the woodland animals to fight back -- and stop the machines. He teaches them what he's learned. When the animals begin winning the battle, scientists try to catch Jack and some of his friends whom Jack has to rescue. Hiding in Collin's house, Jack and Collin figure out a way to communicate -- until Jack has to go into hiding. It's soon a battle and only one of them is going to win; if the scientists win, they will capture Jack and study him, but if Jack and the animals win, they can teach what they've learned to other animals who can then protect their homes. Based on the third-grade science curriculum teaching simple machines, this adventure trilogy presents STEM principles in an adventurous, fun, and fast paced story with irresistible animal characters.","Until Hollywood calls, Charlotte is working on her MFA/Professional Writer degree and working on several novels.
