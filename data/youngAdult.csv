Young Adult,mariaeandreu@verizon.net,Maria E. Andreu,"Maria E. Andreu is the author of <i>Love in English</i> (Balzer + Bray, 2021), about a sixteen-year-old who has just moved to the United States and can barely understand what's going on around her. The book was an Indie Next Pick and Junior Library Guild Gold Standard Selection. Andreu's next book, as-yet untitled, is scheduled for release in 2022. Her work has appeared in <i>Literary Hub</i>, <i>Teen Vogue</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, NJ.com, and the <i>Newark Star Ledger</i>.

Her debut young adult novel, <i>The Secret Side of Empty</i>, was a Junior Library Guild Selection, a National Indie Excellence Book Award winner, and an International Latino Book Awards Finalist. It was described as ""a compelling and timely story"" by <i>Horn Book Reviews</i> and “captivating” by <i>School Library Journal</i>. Maria is Latinx and Argentinian-American and currently lives in New Jersey just outside New York City. Her work has been informed by her experiences as a formerly undocumented, non-native English speaker and immigrant to the U.S. She is the queen of rooting for the happy ending, also queen of not being sure about it.","Sixteen-year-old Ana has just moved to the U.S. for her Junior year of high school. She’s a poet and a lover of language except that now, she can barely understand what’s going on around her. It’s a story that is simultaneously charming and romantic, while articulating a deeper story about what it means to become “American”.","Love in English, 978-0062996510

Middle Grades,dbeck.jacobson@outlook.com,Darlene Beck-Jacobson,"Darlene Beck Jacobson is a former teacher and speech therapist who has loved writing since she was a girl. She is also a lover of history and can often be found mining dusty closets and drawers in search of skeletons from her past. She enjoys adding these bits of her ancestry to stories such as the middle grade historical novel <i>Wheels of Change</i> (Creston 2014), which was chosen as a 2015 Notable Social-Studies Trade Book by the Children’s Book Council (CBC), a 2015 Mighty Girl Pick, and 2015 Honorable Mention for The Grateful American Book Prize. Her middle grade novel-in-verse <i>Wishes, Dares, And How To Stand Up To A Bully</i> (Creston 2020) was named a Notable Verse Novel for 2021 by the CBC.

Darlene lives and writes her stories in New Jersey with her family and a house full of dust bunnies. She's caught many fish, but never asked one to grant her a wish. She's a firm believer in wishes coming true, so she tries to be careful what she wishes for.

Her blog features recipes, activities, crafts, articles on nature, book reviews, and interviews with children's book authors and illustrators.","Eleven year old Jack misses his Dad who is MIA in Vietnam. It's been months since he and his family had word of his whereabouts. The last thing Jack wants to do is spend summer with his grandparents. Mom believes it will be good for them all -- Jack, his sister Katy, Mom, Gran and Pops -- to be together while they wait for word about Dad. Keeping busy will keep them out of trouble and help them think of other things. Jack expects the worst summer of his life. The first summer without. Without Dad, without friends, without his room and all the things that remind him of Dad. When Jack meets a girl named Jill -- a girl with a brother who makes trouble for both of them -- things they believe are turned upside down. Welcome to a summer of fishing, camping, bullies, and a fish who grants wishes. A fish that could be the answer to Jack's problem. But when Jill makes wishes of her own, things don't turn out the way they expected. Every wish has a consequence. Will the fish grant Jack's biggest wish? Will Jack be brave enough to ask?","WISHES, DARES, AND HOW TO STAND UP TO A BULLY (Creston 2020)  ISBN: 978-1-939547-62-0",http://www.darlenebeckjacobson.com,,,,,,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/ad458d96-15eb-43de-ae1a-64802d962dda/Beck-Jacobson_Headshot.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/bb55459b-b54b-4510-a696-582b6fdcf291/Beck-Jacobson_Book_Cover.jpg,Being able to talk face to face with readers about their favorite books and authors and feel the excitement as they share their enthusiasm.,,"Being outside at my favorite venue is always something to look forward to.

Jack becomes distressed when construction machines show up, planning to cut down his woods and tree. When Collin shows Jack how to use simple machines like the wheel, Jack begins a plan to use what Collin teaches him and gather all the woodland animals to fight back -- and stop the machines. He teaches them what he's learned. When the animals begin winning the battle, scientists try to catch Jack and some of his friends whom Jack has to rescue. Hiding in Collin's house, Jack and Collin figure out a way to communicate -- until Jack has to go into hiding. It's soon a battle and only one of them is going to win; if the scientists win, they will capture Jack and study him, but if Jack and the animals win, they can teach what they've learned to other animals who can then protect their homes.
