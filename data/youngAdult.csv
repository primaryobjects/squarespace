mariaeandreubooks@gmail.com,Maria E. Andreu,"Maria E. Andreu is the author of Love in English (Balzer + Bray, 2021), an Indie Next Pick and Junior Library Guild Gold Standard Selection, which received a starred review from School Library Journal. Filled with with playful and poetic breakouts exploring the idiosyncrasies of the English language, it tells the tale of Ana, a girl who has recently moved from Argentina to the United States, in a narrative that's layered with themes of immigration, cultural identity, and finding your voice in any language.

Her prior young adult novel, The Secret Side of Empty, tells the story of M.T., an undocumented high school senior, and was inspired by Maria's own experiences of being undocumented. The book is a Junior Library Guild Selection, a National Indie Excellence Book Award winner, an International Latino Book Awards Finalist and has been called ""captivating"" by School Library Journal. 

Maria's writing has appeared in Literary Hub, Teen Vogue, Newsweek, The Washington Post and NJ.com. She is at work on a memoir about her experiences as an undocumented immigrant and non-native speaker of English. She lives in New Jersey with her two children on a grassy hill frequented by black squirrels, deer with impressive jumping range and the occasional fox and turkey.","LOVE IN ENGLISH, 2.2.21, ISBN: 978-0062996510

dbeck.jacobson@outlook.com,Darlene Beck Jacobson,"Darlene Beck Jacobson is a former teacher and speech therapist who has loved writing since she was a girl. She is also a lover of history and can often be found mining dusty closets and drawers in search of skeletons from her past. She enjoys adding these bits of her ancestry to stories such as her award-winning middle grade historical novel WHEELS OF CHANGE (Creston 2014) and her middle grade novel-in-verse WISHES, DARES, AND HOW TO STAND UP TO A BULLY (Creston 2020)

Darlene lives and writes her stories in New Jersey with her family and a house full of dust bunnies. She’s caught many fish, but never asked one to grant her a wish. She’s a firm believer in wishes coming true, so she tries to be careful what she wishes for.

Her blog features recipes, activities, crafts, articles on nature, book reviews, and interviews with children’s book authors and illustrators.","Wishes, Dares, and How To Stand Up To a Bully (Creston 2020) ISBN: 978-1-939547-62-0",http://www.darlenebeckjacobson.com,,,https://twitter.com/dbeckjacobson,,,,I enjoy the face to face connection and being able to share my stories with readers and answer their questions.,How old are you?,Meeting in person again and being able to share books with readers and other authors.
