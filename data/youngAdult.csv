She spent many years studying and writing music and lyrics but transitioned to strictly writing for children when her son was born in 2007. Musical and lyrical qualities can always be found in her picture books.

J's stories focus on empathy, diversity and social emotional issues as well as love and respect for each other and this beautiful planet that we all share. She wants to not only entertain, but empower young readers and honor their curiosity and wonder.

It's time for little Crue's first big adventure with his Great Uncle Ollie, but he can't help but worry: What if the boat breaks? Or an octopus swallows them in one gulp? Or a family of whales takes over the boat?

It seems the worries will follow him around forever until Great Uncle Ollie squeezes his hand and shares his secret mantra: Be calm, it will pass. Through storms . . . Be calm, it will pass . . . passing sharks . . . Be calm, it will pass . . . even through a pirate attack . . . Be calm, it will pass . . . Great Uncle Ollie's mantra keeps Crue afloat until it's time for a solo journey of his own.

As the hazy days of September 1918 drift into the deadly autumn of Spanish influenza, Josie’s everyday problems of school and friends, even the war effort at home, become insignificant when her mother comes down with the flu.
