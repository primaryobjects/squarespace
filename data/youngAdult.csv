Young Adult,mariaeandreu@verizon.net,Maria E. Andreu,"Maria E. Andreu is the author of <i>Love in English</i> (Balzer + Bray, 2021), about a sixteen-year-old who has just moved to the United States and can barely understand what's going on around her. The book was an Indie Next Pick and Junior Library Guild Gold Standard Selection. Andreu's next book, as-yet untitled, is scheduled for release in 2022. Her work has appeared in <i>Literary Hub</i>, <i>Teen Vogue</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, NJ.com, and the <i>Newark Star Ledger</i>.

Her debut young adult novel, <i>The Secret Side of Empty</i>, was a Junior Library Guild Selection, a National Indie Excellence Book Award winner, and an International Latino Book Awards Finalist. It was described as ""a compelling and timely story"" by <i>Horn Book Reviews</i> and “captivating” by <i>School Library Journal</i>. Maria is Latinx and Argentinian-American and currently lives in New Jersey just outside New York City. Her work has been informed by her experiences as a formerly undocumented, non-native English speaker and immigrant to the U.S. She is the queen of rooting for the happy ending, also queen of not being sure about it.","Sixteen-year-old Ana has just moved to the U.S. for her Junior year of high school. She’s a poet and a lover of language except that now, she can barely understand what’s going on around her. It’s a story that is simultaneously charming and romantic, while articulating a deeper story about what it means to become “American”.","
