Jack becomes distressed when construction machines show up, planning to cut down his woods and tree. When Collin shows Jack how to use simple machines like the wheel, Jack begins a plan to use what Collin teaches him and gather all the woodland animals to fight back -- and stop the machines. He teaches them what he's learned. When the animals begin winning the battle, scientists try to catch Jack and some of his friends whom Jack has to rescue. Hiding in Collin's house, Jack and Collin figure out a way to communicate -- until Jack has to go into hiding. It's soon a battle and only one of them is going to win; if the scientists win, they will capture Jack and study him, but if Jack and the animals win, they can teach what they've learned to other animals who can then protect their homes. Based on the third-grade science curriculum teaching simple machines, this adventure trilogy presents STEM principles in an adventurous, fun, and fast paced story with irresistible animal characters.","Until Hollywood calls, Charlotte is working on her MFA/Professional Writer degree and working on several novels.

Middle Grades,jdonninibooks@gmail.com,Joy Donnini,"A charming reminder for kids that even the worst things don't last forever. 

""Unlike many picture books that seek to comfort young audiences by assuring them that their apprehensions are unfounded, Donnini's quiet prose shows readers that worry is a feeling as valid as any other . . . the world is an increasingly worrisome place, and books like this one, that offer simple acknowledgement of this fact, are just as essential as those that offer elaborate escape. Timely assurance of the impermanence of life's difficulties."" -- Kirkus Reviews

It's time for little Crue's first big adventure with his Great Uncle Ollie, but he can't help but worry: What if the boat breaks? Or an octopus swallows them in one gulp? Or a family of whales takes over the boat?

It seems the worries will follow him around forever until Great Uncle Ollie squeezes his hand and shares his secret mantra: Be calm, it will pass. Through storms . . . Be calm, it will pass . . . passing sharks . . . Be calm, it will pass . . . even through a pirate attack . . . Be calm, it will pass . . . Great Uncle Ollie's mantra keeps Crue afloat until it's time for a solo journey of his own.

For kids who worry or stress over life's troubles, This Will Pass is a welcome lesson in mindful patience.","J.Donnini is a children's book author, musician, professional daydreamer and a mother, which she considers her most important job. She spent many years studying and writing music and lyrics but transitioned to strictly writing for children when her son was born in 2007.

J's stories focus on empathy, diversity and social emotional issues as well as love and respect for each other and this beautiful planet that we all share. She not only wants to entertain, but empower the young readers and honor their curiosity and wonder. 

J's published works include Ruby Lee, Echoes, Fireflies, The Spirit Bunnies, Patches and the Spirit Bunnies, Rock and the Fly and her latest This Will Pass, published by Bushel & Peck books.

Middle Grades,kate@kateszegda.com,Kate Szegda,"Pharmacy Girl is middle-grade historical fiction about the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic in New Jersey.

Before COVID there was Spanish influenza. In 1918 there were masks. Schools, restaurants, and even churches closed. A nation at war curtailed the draft. One in four Americans stricken, and an estimated 675,000 Americans dead. All because of a deadly germ carried on a puff of air. But there were no effective vaccines. No ventilators. No medicines to stop a virus. And a war to win.

Everyone likes Josie, except the spoiled and arrogant Billy Detwiler. He calls her Pharmacy Girl, but it is no compliment. As the hazy days of September 1918 drift into the deadly autumn of Spanish influenza, Josie’s everyday problems of school and friends, even the war effort at home, become insignificant when her mother comes down with the flu. But Josie is no slacker. She faces Billy in a class election, raises money for the Liberty Loan, and steps up to help her family when the pandemic strikes home.
