Middle Grades,dbeck.jacobson@outlook.com,Darlene Beck-Jacobson,"Eleven year old Jack misses his Dad who is MIA in Vietnam. It's been months since he and his family had word of his whereabouts. The last thing Jack wants to do is spend summer with his grandparents. Mom believes it will be good for them all -- Jack, his sister Katy, Mom, Gran and Pops -- to be together while they wait for word about Dad. Keeping busy will keep them out of trouble and help them think of other things.

Jack expects the worst summer of his life. The first summer without. Without Dad, without friends, without his room and all the things that remind him of Dad. When Jack meets a girl named Jill -- a girl with a brother who makes trouble for both of them -- things they believe are turned upside down. Welcome to a summer of fishing, camping, bullies, and a fish who grants wishes. A fish that could be the answer to Jack's problem. But when Jill makes wishes of her own, things don't turn out the way they expected. Every wish has a consequence.

Will the fish grant Jack's biggest wish?  Will Jack be brave enough to ask?","Darlene Beck Jacobson is a former teacher and speech therapist who has loved writing since she was a girl. She is also a lover of history and can often be found mining dusty closets and drawers in search of skeletons from her past. She enjoys adding these bits of her ancestry to stories such as the middle grade historical novel WHEELS OF CHANGE (Creston 2014) which is a 2015 Notable Social-Studies Trade Book from the Children‚Äôs Book Council (CBC), A 2015 Mighty Girl Pick, and The Grateful American Book Prize Honorable mention for 2015. Her middle grade novel-in-verse WISHES, DARES, AND HOW TO STAND UP TO A BULLY (Creston 2020) is a Notable Verse Novel for 2021 from the CBC.

Darlene lives and writes her stories in New Jersey with her family and a house full of dust bunnies. She's caught many fish, but never asked one to grant her a wish. She's a firm believer in wishes coming true, so she tries to be careful what she wishes for.

Her blog features recipes, activities, crafts, articles on nature, book reviews, and interviews with children's book authors and illustrators.","WISHES, DARES, AND HOW TO STAND UP TO A BULLY (Creston 2020)  ISBN: 978-1-939547-62-0",http://www.darlenebeckjacobson.com,,,https://twitter.com/dbjacobson,,,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/ad458d96-15eb-43de-ae1a-64802d962dda/Beck-Jacobson_Headshot.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/bb55459b-b5
