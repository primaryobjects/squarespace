mariaeandreubooks@gmail.com,Maria E. Andreu,"Maria E. Andreu is the author of Love in English (Balzer + Bray, 2021), an Indie Next Pick and Junior Library Guild Gold Standard Selection, which received a starred review from School Library Journal. Filled with with playful and poetic breakouts exploring the idiosyncrasies of the English language, it tells the tale of Ana, a girl who has recently moved from Argentina to the United States, in a narrative that's layered with themes of immigration, cultural identity, and finding your voice in any language.

Her prior young adult novel, The Secret Side of Empty, tells the story of M.T., an undocumented high school senior, and was inspired by Maria's own experiences of being undocumented. The book is a Junior Library Guild Selection, a National Indie Excellence Book Award winner, an International Latino Book Awards Finalist and has been called ""captivating"" by School Library Journal. 

Maria's writing has appeared in Literary Hub, Teen Vogue, Newsweek, The Washington Post and NJ.com. She is at work on a memoir about her experiences as an undocumented immigrant and non-native speaker of English. She lives in New Jersey with her two children on a grassy hill frequented by black squirrels, deer with impressive jumping range and the occasional fox and turkey.","LOVE IN ENGLISH, 2.2.21, ISBN: 978-0062996510
