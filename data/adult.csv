info@thesecretapartment.com,Tom Garvey,"Tom Garvey, an Airborne, Ranger and Special Forces qualified officer, served as an A-Team Leader in Viet Nam in 1968 and returned home to mixed reviews about his stability and state of mind. Like many other Viet Nam Veterans, he found few who cared to hear about his time overseas. Within one week of his homecoming, he was a full-time college student while working forty hours a week at night. In 1971 he graduated magna cum laude from Widener University in Chester, PA. After college, the kindest way to put it is that ""the wheels came off"" and he struggled to survive with menial jobs until he met the love of his life, Peggy Bertholf. Prior to meeting Peg, one of his jobs was as a cashier/supervisor in the parking lots surrounding Veteran's Stadium. The Secret Apartment is Tom's surreal memoir about the days when he lived beneath the 300-level seats of Veteran's Stadium.","The Secret Apartment: Vet Stadium, a surreal memoir",http://thesecretapartment.com/,https://www.facebook.com/thesecretapartmentbook/,,,,,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/4793badc-3e3f-4a3c-8a69-8e5809f06587/Garvey_Tom.jpg,,,,,,
