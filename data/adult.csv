mikesielski@yahoo.com,Mike Sielski,"Mike Sielski is a columnist for The Philadelphia Inquirer and the author of three books. His latest, ""The Rise: Kobe Bryant and the Pursuit of Immortality,"" drew on never-before-heard interview tapes with Bryant and was published in January 2022 to universal praise from readers and reviewers. Publishers Weekly, Booklist, and Library Journal all gave ""The Rise"" starred reviews, and Library Journal called it “a landmark account of Kobe Bryant’s early life [that] will stand as the most objective, definitive record of his youth.” An accompanying podcast, ""I Am Kobe,"" which Sielski wrote and narrated, was released in November 2021 through iHeartRadio and won the 2022 Webby Award for “excellence on the Internet” in the Best Sports Podcast category.

Published in 2009, Sielski’s book ""Fading Echoes: A True Story of Rivalry and Brotherhood from the Football Field to the Fields of Honor"" received starred reviews from both Publishers Weekly and Library Journal. Booklist called it “an emotionally charged book that offers a profound understanding of American life in the first years of the twenty-first century.” Sielski’s first book—""How to Be like Jackie Robinson: Life Lessons from Baseball’s Greatest Hero,"" which he co-authored with longtime NBA executive Pat Williams—was published in 2005.

An alumnus of La Salle University and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism who joined The Inquirer in 2013, Sielski has established himself as one of the most recognized and respected voices in a city and a region where sports is not a pastime but a civic religion, and his writing stretches beyond sports into the realms of culture, politics, and American history. The Associated Press Sports Editors voted him the country’s top sports columnist in 2015—one of 13 times the organization has honored him and his writing—and his peers, through the National Sports Media Association, voted him Pennsylvania’s Sportswriter of the Year in 2016. Sielski’s work has been anthologized three times in ""The Best American Sports Writing/The Year’s Best Sports Writing"" series, and he has received more than forty other national, state, and local awards from organizations such as the United States Basketball Writers Association, the Philadelphia Sportswriters Association, the Society for Features Journalism, and the Order Sons and Daughters of Italy in America.

Before The Inquirer hired him, Sielski spent more than three years as a reporter with The Wall Street Journal, covering the National Football League, Major League Baseball, and the National Hockey League as part of the paper’s push to change the nature of daily sports journalism. He appears regularly as a guest and host on WIP 94.1 FM, was a contributor to NBC Sports Philadelphia, and has established a recognizable presence on national television, radio, and podcasts, including on ESPN, The NFL Network, and National Public Radio.
