This heartwarming story spotlights the special bond between mother and daughter as they navigate the nervous feelings that come along with a brand new experience.","Marisa Castronova, Ph.D. is a wife and mother of two beautiful children. Her entire family is a continuous inspiration for her stories and all members have listened to more versions of her manuscripts than she would care to admit.

She has been featured twice on the Emmy award winning television program, Classroom Close-up, NJ, where her expertise in science education has been highlighted.

ammwrite@gmail.com,Ann Magee,"The branches of the 9/11 Survivor Tree poked through the rubble at Ground Zero. They were glimpses of hope in the weeks after September 11, 2001.

Remember and honor the events of 9/11 and celebrate how hope appears in the midst of hardship. The Survivor Tree found at Ground Zero was rescued, rehabilitated, and then replanted at the 9/11 Memorial site in 2011. This is its story.

In this moving tribute to a city and its people, a wordless story of a young child accompanies the tree's history. As the tree heals, the girl grows into an adult, and by the 20th anniversary of 9/11, she has become a firefighter like her first-responder uncle. A life-affirming introduction to how 9/11 affected the United States and how we recovered together.","Debut author Ann Magee has been a Jersey girl all her life. A former elementary-school teacher, she loves teaching reading and writing. She lives with her husband and three children -- her favorite people -- in New Jersey.","BRANCHES OF HOPE: THE 9/11 SURVIVOR TREE, publication date May 18, 2021, ISBN 978-1623541323",annmagee.net,,https://www.instagram.com/ammwrite,https://twitter.com/ann_ammwrite,,,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/637d1328-b83d-4da4-88d9-1445c1bfcdc6/Magee_Headshot.jpg,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/922a08e9-baab-4801-b425-e6f6e67cd66a/Magee_Book_Cover_.jpg,I'm happy to share unknown true stories with readers and to hear what they think about the topic.,,I look forward to talking to people who have their own memories of 9/11 as well as those who don't yet know the hopeful story of the 9/11 Survivor Tree.
