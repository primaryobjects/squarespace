This job brings her face-to-face with her mortal enemy, her ultimate crush, a territorial patron, an elderly movie fanatic, a super-tall painter who likes to bake, and a homeless dog. Over the course of the summer, as Jamie gets to know the library and the people in it, she finds —and gives—help where she least expects it. And, much to her surprise, finds herself along the way! A novel full of book references, literary quotes, spine poetry, and very unique baked goods, A KIND OF PARADISE is not to be missed! Tan's star reviewed second novel, SUMMER AT MEADOW WOOD, about Jamie's best friend Vic, will also be available at the festival.",,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/db19081c-620e-407a-a29a-50b04f90e96b/A+Kind+of+Paradise.jpeg,

They were glimpses of hope in the weeks after September 11, 2001. Remember and honor the events of 9/11 and celebrate how hope appears in the midst of hardship. The Survivor Tree found at Ground Zero was rescued, rehabilitated, and then replanted at the 9/11 Memorial site in 2011. This is its story. In this moving tribute to a city and its people, a wordless story of a young child accompanies the tree's history. As the tree heals, the girl grows into an adult, and by the 20th anniversary of 9/11, she has become a firefighter like her first-responder uncle. A life-affirming introduction to how 9/11 affected the United States and how we recovered together.",,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/6151ac1d-397b-4228-8475-7023c3161811/Branches+of+Hope.png,
