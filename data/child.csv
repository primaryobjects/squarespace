This job brings her face-to-face with her mortal enemy, her ultimate crush, a territorial patron, an elderly movie fanatic, a super-tall painter who likes to bake, and a homeless dog. Over the course of the summer, as Jamie gets to know the library and the people in it, she finds —and gives—help where she least expects it. And, much to her surprise, finds herself along the way! A novel full of book references, literary quotes, spine poetry, and very unique baked goods, A KIND OF PARADISE is not to be missed!

They were glimpses of hope in the weeks after September 11, 2001. Remember and honor the events of 9/11 and celebrate how hope appears in the midst of hardship. The Survivor Tree found at Ground Zero was rescued, rehabilitated, and then replanted at the 9/11 Memorial site in 2011. This is its story. In this moving tribute to a city and its people, a wordless story of a young child accompanies the tree's history. As the tree heals, the girl grows into an adult, and by the 20th anniversary of 9/11, she has become a firefighter like her first-responder uncle. A life-affirming introduction to how 9/11 affected the United States and how we recovered together.",,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/6151ac1d-397b-4228-8475-7023c3161811/Branches+of+Hope.png,

As the family grows, the house delights in the sound of laughter echoing in its halls and the pitter-patter of little feet traversing its floors and realizes it is no longer just a house. It has become a home―their home. One day, the family packs up, and with tears in their eyes, they say goodbye. The house doesn’t know if it can ever be happy again until a special couple appears and it begins to feel a sliver of hope. Perhaps it can become a home once more…

Told from the perspective of a house, this story’s heartfelt text and beautiful illustrations convey a warmth of feeling as two families change and grow at different times within the same four walls.",,https://colleenrowankosinski.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/AHA_cover_2094x2436-scaled.jpg,
