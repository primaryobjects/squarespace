Over the course of the summer, as Jamie gets to know the library and the people in it, she finds —and gives—help where she least expects it. And, much to her surprise, finds herself along the way!

The Survivor Tree found at Ground Zero was rescued, rehabilitated, and then replanted at the 9/11 Memorial site in 2011. This is its story. In this moving tribute to a city and its people, a wordless story of a young child accompanies the tree's history.

It has become a home―their home. One day, the family packs up, and with tears in their eyes, they say goodbye. The house doesn’t know if it can ever be happy again until a special couple appears and it begins to feel a sliver of hope. Perhaps it can become a home once more…

Told from the perspective of a house, this story’s heartfelt text and beautiful illustrations convey a warmth of feeling as two families change and grow at different times within the same four walls.",,https://colleenrowankosinski.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/AHA_cover_2094x2436-scaled.jpg,

She is also a lover of history and can often be found mining dusty closets in search of skeletons from her past. She enjoys adding these bits of her ancestry to stories such as her award-winning middle grade historical novel WHEELS OF CHANGE (Creston 2014) selected as a Notable Social Studies Trade Book in 2015. Her most recent novel, WISHES, DARES, & HOW TO STAND UP TO A BULLY (Creston 2020) is an historical novel in verse set in 1964 involving bullying and a fish who grants wishes. 
	Darlene lives and writes her stories in New Jersey with her family and a house full of dust bunnies. She’s caught many fish, but has never asked one to grant her a wish. She’s a firm believer in wishes coming true, so she tries to be careful what she wishes for.

The woodpeckers are rat-tat-tatting, the squirrels are cracka-cracka-crunching--there's too much noise! When Shelby spies the perfect cave, only too late does he realize he's hopped aboard a tour bus bound for the beach.

Coupled with hysterically expressive illustrations by Stephanie Laberis, Julie Gonzalez's lively text and familiar refrain sing as Shelby, after several attempts to snooze in the tropics, finally discovers a clever way to fix his noise problem. This book is a fun read-aloud for younger readers who will recognize the refrain (""How could a bear sleep here?"") and the silliness of Shelby's predicament. (Grade level: Preschool-3)
