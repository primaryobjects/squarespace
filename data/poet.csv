malik.abja@gmail.com,Malik Abduh,"Malik Abduh is a poet and essayist. He earned an MFA in Creative Writing from Rutgers University-Camden, where he received the 2008 Rutgers University Alumni Association Creative Writing Award. He teaches English at Rowan College at Burlington County and is the editor of the College’s journal, <i>The Baron Anthology<i>. His work appears in several journals and magazines, including <i>Southern Indiana Review<i>, <i>Four Way Review<i>, <i>Exit 7, <i>Slush<i>, and <i>Some Call it Ballin’ Magazine<i>. His debut collection, <i>All the Stars Aflame,<i> is published by Get Fresh Books Publishing.

In his debut collection, <i>All the Stars Aflame,<i>'' he relates the brutal legacy of U.S. racial violence, including lynchings, riots, uprisings, and political assassinations, told in the voices of those who experienced these tragedies firsthand. Likewise, Abduh chronicles his own life experiences: sneaking as a young boy to listen to Richard Pryor records, lamenting the gentrification of his old neighborhood, and struggling to build his daughter a doll house. Thus, this volume is a balance between historical record and personal narrative. Rich with vivid imagery, tragic irony, anddark humor, <i>All the Stars Aflame<i> is a timely poetic debut.",,"https://platformreview.org/malik-abduh#:~:text=Malik%20Abduh%20is%20a%20poet,College's%20journal%2C%20The%20Baron%20Anthology",,,,,,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/4887f8de-a8de-438f-98a6-6b9c435aaea0/D5954C9D-242A-4651-8943-1500DF1DEE49.jpeg,,,

I was giving a reading in Florida the year I was the Florida Writers circuit poet. During a Q and A, someone asked if I believed in God or gods and what I felt was sacred in the world. It wasn’t a weird question so much as a highly profound but possibly provocative one, but it led to a discussion of art and poetry and their relationship to both the sacred and the profane. 

The toughest question I was ever asked was by a young man after a discussion of a Tony Hoagland poem. He said he didn’t mean to be offensive, but he wanted to know what Hoagland meant by the difference between having sex and making love. He was the only identified male in a workshop of all women. It was a brave question and the discussion that followed left some of us in tears but all of us a little kinder.","Doing the event with BJ Ward on Stephen Dunn
