In his debut collection, <i>All the Stars Aflame,<i>'' he relates the brutal legacy of U.S. racial violence, including lynchings, riots, uprisings, and political assassinations, told in the voices of those who experienced these tragedies firsthand. Likewise, Abduh chronicles his own life experiences: sneaking as a young boy to listen to Richard Pryor records, lamenting the gentrification of his old neighborhood, and struggling to build his daughter a doll house. Thus, this volume is a balance between historical record and personal narrative. Rich with vivid imagery, tragic irony, anddark humor, <i>All the Stars Aflame<i> is a timely poetic debut.",,"https://platformreview.org/malik-abduh#:~:text=Malik%20Abduh%20is%20a%20poet,College's%20journal%2C%20The%20Baron%20Anthology",,,,,,https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f1cb0d99322d817a05021ad/cd1949ef-a75d-46cf-acbb-5c7229382fe5/5761863D-064
